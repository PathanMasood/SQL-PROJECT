# Walmart Sales Data Analysis


## Overview

This project involved conducting an in-depth analysis of sales data from Walmart to gain insights into factors affecting sales performance and inform strategic decision-making. The analysis leveraged SQL for data querying and Python for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Description

The project explored historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across different regions, encompassing various departments and holiday markdown events. The aim was to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to optimize sales strategies and improve profitability.

## Data Description

- Dataset obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, comprising 1000 rows and 17 columns.
- Columns include invoice ID, branch location, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, total revenue, date, time, payment method, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage, gross income, and rating.

## Analysis Approach

- Conducted data wrangling to handle missing values and perform feature engineering to derive new insights from existing data.
- Utilized SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the database, focusing on identifying unique cities, popular product lines, and sales trends.
- Employed Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

## Business Questions and Insights

- Addressed key business questions such as the number of unique cities in the dataset, most common payment methods, and top-selling product lines.
- Identified actionable insights regarding customer segmentation, purchase trends, and branch performance to optimize sales strategies and enhance profitability.

## Results and Impact

- Quantified improvements in sales strategies and revenue optimization based on data-driven insights.
- Received recognition for analytical skills and contributions to strategic decision-making processes.
